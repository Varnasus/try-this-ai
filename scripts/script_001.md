Ever wish you could just *talk* to a PDF? Now you can.

Grab the PDF and send it to a local parser like PyMuPDF or Unstructured.io. Chunk the text, clean it up, and send it into OpenAI's GPT-4o with a simple conversational prompt.

No fine-tuning, no vector store—just raw Q&A on top of your document.

Want it smarter? Add context re-ranking or embed with LangChain.

Now you’ve got a chatbot that knows your doc better than you do.

Try it yourself at platform.openai.com.
